This codebase follows [Google's Objective-C Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/objcguide.xml)
including the use of two-space indentation. Both Objective-C and Swift may be
used for new code.

The primary services/singletons within the program are as follows:

* `NYPLAccount`
* `NYPLBookCoverRegistry` (used directly only by `NYPLBookRegistry`)
* `NYPLBookRegistry`
* `NYPLConfiguration`
* `NYPLKeychain`
* `NYPLMyBooksDownloadCenter`

All of the above contain appropriate documentation in the header files.

The rest of the program follows Apple's usual pattern of passive views,
relatively passive models, and one-off controllers for integrating everything.
Immutability is preferred wherever possible.

Questions and suggestions should be submitted as GitHub issues and tagged with
the appropriate labels. More in-depth discussion occurs via Slack: Email
`jamesenglish@nypl.org` for access.
